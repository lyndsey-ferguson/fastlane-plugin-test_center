[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-test_center)

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-test_center`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin test_center
```

## About test_center

This plugin makes testing your iOS app easier by providing you actions that give you greater control over everthing related to testing your app.

This fastlane plugin includes the following actions:
- [`multi_scan`](#multi-scan): gives you control over how your tests are exercised.
- [`suppress_tests_from_junit`](#suppress_tests_from_junit): from a test report, suppresses tests in your project.
- [`suppress_tests`](#suppress_tests): from a provided list, suppresses tests in your project.
- [`suppressed_tests`](#suppressed_tests): returns a list of the suppressed tests in your project.
- [`tests_from_junit`](#tests_from_junit): from a test report, returns lists of passing and failed tests.
- [`tests_from_xctestrun`](#tests_from_xctestrun): from an xctestrun file, returns a list of tests for each of its test targets.
- [`collate_junit_reports`](#collate_junit_reports): combines multiple test reports into one.

### multi-scan 🎉

Is the fragile test infrastructure provided by `xcodebuild` failing tests inexplicably and getting you down 😢? Use the `:try_count` option to re-run those failed tests multiple times to ensure that any fragility is ironed out and only truly failing tests appear.

Is the sheer number of UI tests overloading the iOS Simulator and causing it to become useless? Run your tests in batches using the `:batch_count` option in order to lighten the load on the simulator.

Do you get frustrated when your automated test system keeps running after the fragile test infrastructure stops working halfway through your tests 😡? Use the `:testrun_completed_block` callback to bailout early or make adjustments on how your tests are exercised.

Do you have multiple test targets and the normal operation of `scan` is providing you a test report that implies that all the tests ran in one test target? Don't worry, `multi_scan` has fixed that.

### suppress_tests_from_junit

No time to fix a failing test? Suppress the `:failed` tests in your project and create and prioritize a ticket in your bug tracking system. 

Want to create a special CI job that only re-tries failing tests? Suppress the `:passing` tests in your project and exercise your fragile tests.

### suppress_tests

Have some tests that you want turned off? Give the list to this action in order to suppress them for your project.

### suppressed_tests

Do you have an automated process that requires the list of suppressed tests in your project? Use this action to get that.

### tests_from_junit

Performing analysis on a test report file? Get the lists of failing and passing tests using this action.

### tests_from_xctestrun

Do you have multiple test targets referenced by your `xctestrun` file and need to know all the tests? Use this action to go through each test target, collect the tests, and return them to you in a simple and usable structure.

### collate_junit_reports

Do you have multiple test reports coming in from different sources and need it combined? Use this action to collate all the tests performed for a given test target into one report file.
