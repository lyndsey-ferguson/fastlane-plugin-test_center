Have you ever spent too much time trying to fix fragile tests only to give up with nothing real to show? Use the `fastlane` actions from `test_center` to remove the pain around your tests, so that you can focus on what makes üí∞: features that customers love üòç.

## Features

This plugin makes testing your iOS app easier by providing you actions that give you greater control over everthing related to testing your app. 

`multi_scan` began when I created an action to only re-run the failed tests in order to determine if they were truly failing, or if they were failing randomly due to a fragile infrastructure. This action morphed into an entire plugin with many actions in the testing category.

This fastlane plugin includes the following actions:

_read the documentation on each action by clicking on the action name_

| Action | Description | Supported Platforms |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
|[`multi_scan`](docs/feature_details/multi_scan.md)| supports everthing that [`scan`](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/scan/) (also known as `run_tests`) does, and also supports:</br></br>- dividing your tests evenly into batches and run each batch on its own Simulator in parallel to reduce the time to test</br>- re-running tests that may be failing due to a fragile test environment</br>- splitting tests into batches when a huge number of tests overwhelm the Simulator</br> - performing an action after a block of tests have been run| ios, mac |
| [`suppress_tests_from_junit`](docs/feature_details/suppress_tests_from_junit.md) | suppress tests in an Xcode Scheme using those in a Junit test report | ios, mac |
| [`suppress_tests`](docs/feature_details/suppress_tests.md) | suppress tests in an Xcode Scheme | ios, mac |
| [`suppressed_tests`](docs/feature_details/suppressed_tests.md) | returns a list of the suppressed tests in your Xcode Project or Scheme | ios, mac |
| [`tests_from_junit`](docs/feature_details/tests_from_junit.md) | returns the passing and failing tests in a Junit test report | ios, mac |
| [`tests_from_xctestrun`](docs/feature_details/tests_from_xctestrun.md) | returns a list of tests for each test target in a `xctestrun` file  | ios, mac |
| [`collate_junit_reports`](docs/feature_details/collate_junit_reports.md) | combines multiple Junit test reports into one report | ios, mac |
| [`collate_html_reports`](docs/feature_details/collate_html_reports.md) | combines multiple HTML test reports into one report | ios, mac |
| [`collate_json_reports`](docs/feature_details/collate_json_reports.md) | combines multiple json test reports into one report | ios, mac |
| [`collate_test_result_bundles`](docs/feature_details/collate_test_result_bundles.md) | combines multiple test_result bundles into one test_result bundle | ios, mac |


## Installation

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-test_center`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin test_center
```

## Usage

Click the name of each action [above](#features) and review the documentation to learn how to use each action.

The most popular action in the `test_center` plugin is `multi_scan`, and if you run your tests in parallel with multiple retries, they will finish faster and only the truly failing tests will be reported as failing:

```action
multi_scan(
  project: File.absolute_path('../AtomicBoy/AtomicBoy.xcodeproj'),
  scheme: 'AtomicBoy',
  try_count: 3, # retry _failing_ tests up to three times^1. 
  fail_build: false,
  parallel_testrun_count: 4 # run subsets of your tests on parallel simulators^2
)
# [1] The ones that pass on a retry probably failed due to test interactions or test infrastructure
# [2] splits all your tests into 4 smaller batches and runs each batch on its own sim in parallel for faster completion!
```
